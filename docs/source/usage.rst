The project is developed using MATLAB codes. 
   

Project Structure
-----------------

The project is organized into four distinct branches:


- `main`: Contains all the techniques discussed in the chapter.
- `baseline`: Implements the baseline technique discussed in the chapter.
- `reward_shaping`: Implementation of the reward shaping technique.
- `action_shielding`: Implementation of the action shielding technique.

   

Implementation Guideline
-----------------

Follow these steps to successfully implement the project:


1. Navigate to the `main.m` script.

2. Configure the desired number of agents you wish to simulate.

3. Execute the script.

4. Once completed, collect key flight statistics, including NMAC and Computation time.

5. Save your environment as a `.mat` file.

6. To visualize the results, import the saved `.mat` file into the `animate.m` script and run it.


For more detailed information on each step, refer to the corresponding sections in the documentation.
