Investigating Wind Impact on UAS-Operations from a Battery Energy Perspective
===================================

   
Overview
--------

The overall objective of this project is to develop a framework to quantify uncertainty in mission success due to available battery energy considering different wind conditions.
This repository is structured into three major tasks which can be summarized as follows: 



#.  **Electro-chemical based Battery Model**
   
   
#. **Detailed Dynamic Model for Octo-rotor**
   

#. **Model-Based Battery Prognostics Architecture**
   
The battery model utilized in this study is an electro-chemical-based model of Lithium-ion batteries, as described in [1], which are a popular choice for powering unmanned aerial vehicles.
