Since the objective of this paper is to develop a safe and scalable UAM trajectory planning framework, the two criteria we used to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm are mean computational time and the number of Near Mid Air Collisions (NMAC). Mean computation time, which is the time taken in each step by the algorithm to compute the safe trajectory for a single aircraft, demonstrates the computational efficiency of the method. On the other hand, NMAC, defined as a loss of 152 meters of horizontal and 30 meters of vertical separation, is used to evaluate the ability of the algorithm to guide the aircraft and avoid collisions.
