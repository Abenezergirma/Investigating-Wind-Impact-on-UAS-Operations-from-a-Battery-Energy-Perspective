    "The aircraft model we use in this project is an octocopter model, specifically known as Tarrot T18. You can take a look at this paper to understand the dynamic model and low level control design of the aircraft.  `Detailed octorotor modeling and PD control` https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7844562. The main goal this week is to gain a working understanding of this aircraft model. \n",
